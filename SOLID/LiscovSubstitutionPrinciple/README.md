## Liscov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is the "L" in the SOLID principles. It states:

"Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types."

In simpler terms, objects of a subclass should be able to replace objects of the parent class without affecting the correctness of the program.

In more simple terms, it states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

To put it even simpler, if a class (subclass) is derived from another class (superclass), any instance of the superclass should be able to be replaced with an instance of the subclass without causing any unexpected behavior or breaking the code.
