## Open Closed Principle

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, and it states: "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification." In simpler terms, once a class is implemented and tested, it should not be modified to add new features or behavior. Instead, the class should be easily extensible, allowing new functionalities to be added without changing the existing code.
