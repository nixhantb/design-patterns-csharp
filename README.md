## Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide a set of guidelines and best practices to help developers create efficient, maintainable, and flexible code. Think of them as proven blueprints that address specific challenges in software development.

Just like an architect might use standard building plans for common house designs, a software developer can apply design patterns to tackle recurring issues in their code. These patterns encourage clean, organized code that is easy to understand and modify, promoting better collaboration among developers.

Design patterns are not specific algorithms or ready-made code snippets; rather, they are high-level concepts that can be adapted and implemented in various programming languages and frameworks. By using design patterns, developers can save time, avoid common pitfalls, and create more robust and scalable software solutions. Some well-known design patterns include the Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns, among others.
